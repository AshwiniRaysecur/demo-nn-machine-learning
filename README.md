This demo is essentially a port to react of the Synaptic image processing  
perceptron demo. 

I pushed it up here since it has code that exemplifies:

1. Using synaptic in a react app,

2. Using HTML 5 canvas in react, and

3. managing canvas with react 'setState(...)'

In any case it's a really neat machine learning demo...
